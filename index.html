    <p>I'm Sarath Pillai from Bahrain. I'm 20 years old and I study computer science and economics at Brown University. I have currently taken a gap year and am taking some classes with Harvard and in particualar I would like to explore the field of Computer Science.

        <br>
        <span id="p2">Why are you taking this course?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
    I'm taking dynamice web applications to further my knowledge in html and css so that I can be able to turn static webpages into a more dynamic, interactive and database driven interfaces.

        <span id="p2">What previous experience do you have with programming?</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        My experience in programming is extremely limited. I've just very recently begun to look into markup languages such as html, and I've just started to code in python. Essentially I'm only starting to put everything together and I try and use websites like codeacademy to help me with the syntax and then I try to experiment with things by myself.

        I'm working on a MAC
